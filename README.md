### What it does
- Monitors the CPU/GPU temperature and turns the fan to maximum speed when the set temperature is reached.
- Tested on acer aspire V3-571g, should work on 5750g.

### Usage:
1. [Install the drivers provided by Acer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaryn-kubik/AcerFanControl/master/drivers.zip) (run common.exe)
2. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/jaryn-kubik/AcerFanControl/releases/latest)
3. Unzip it somewhere and start it up.
- one slide controls the temperature at which it turns the fan to the max
- other one controls the time after it will tone the fan back down.
- on/off is for manually setting the speed to max
